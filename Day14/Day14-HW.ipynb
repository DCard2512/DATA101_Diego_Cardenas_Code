Indigenous people have been take advantage of with their privacy as many research and data have been reused and used without their permission at all. It is important to keep things ethical for both sides of western culture and Indigenous culture which have different levels of what their ethical concept and usually being ethical to indigenous groups was violated more especially years ago. <br><br><br>\n",

There are many ways to now that we do to protect others data and information safe and even culture. Research on any person should always be done by the permission of the person or group and in the reading it helped show indigenous groups have authorities creating agreements if they agree to go on with research being done. Especially for those ownership,controll, access, and approval.\n"
